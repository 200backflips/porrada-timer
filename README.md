# Meaning Behind The Name
'Porrada' is a noun meaning 'beating' in Portuguese. You will often hear jiu jitsu practicioners refer to their training sessions as 'porradas'. Different academies will have different levels of rough housing and cardiovascularly taxing training methods. You might find yourself in an all out brawl with your training partner at times. This has given birth to the expression 'everyday porrada'.
